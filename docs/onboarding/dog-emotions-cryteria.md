# Context 
After the meeting on 27.10.2022, we established the emotions, that we are going to label and work with. Futher in this document emotions are listed and breifly descibed including cryteria, which we will refer to as for labeling photos. Also worth noting is a fact, that our labeling is targeted to be as general as possible, for eg. (relaxed=sleepy, etc):
# Emotions
